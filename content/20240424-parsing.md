The Financial Instrument Global Identifier (FIGI) is an open alternative to privately owned and licensed identifiers commonly used in financial markets, such as [ISIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Securities_Identification_Number) and [CUSIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUSIP). With a comprehensive [specification](https://www.omg.org/spec/FIGI/1.0/PDF) and a freely accessible [API](https://www.openfigi.com/api), FIGIs are a solid choice for exploring parsing in a financial context. In this post, we explore modeling identifiers with domain types, compare imperative and [ combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator) approaches to parsing, and finally discuss composability and performance of these in a broader system.

## Structure and Characteristics

As defined in § 6.1 of the spec, a FIGI is a "twelve character string semantically meaningless", contrasted with contexually rich identifiers tailored for human use, like stock ticker symbols. They serve to "identify financial instruments at the most granular possible level", while also being durable throughout cororpate actions (e.g., [delistings](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/delistings), [ticker changes](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/symbol-change-history)) and available for all asset classes and regions.

The [charset](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2978) for FIGIs, as defined in § 6.2, is a subset of [ISO 8859-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1), consisting of upper-case [consonants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant) (including "Y") and numerals 0–9. The twelve characters have specific positional rules:

- **Pos 1–2**: two upper-case consonants excluding combinations 'BS', 'BM', 'GG', 'GB', 'GH', 'KY', 'VG'
- **Pos 3**: 'G' (for "global")
- **Pos 4–11**: any combination of upper case consonants and the numerals 0–9
- **Pos 12**: check digit 0–9 calculated using a modified [Luhn algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm)

Bloomberg and Kaiko are the only two [certified providers](https://www.openfigi.com/about/facilitators#certified%20provider) of FIGIs, issuing them for traditional financial instruments and cryptocurrencies, respectively. All FIGIs will have the prefix "BBG" if issued by Bloomberg and "KKG" if issued by Kaiko. For example, the FIGI for Apple Inc. (AAPL) on NYSE is "[BBG000B9XVV8](https://www.openfigi.com/id/BBG000B9XVV8)", whereas the FIGI for BTC/USDT on Binance is "[KKG000003B64](https://instruments.kaiko.com/#/instruments?exchange_code=bnce&base_asset=btc&instrument_figi=KKG000003B64)".

## Modeling FIGIs in Rust

Trading and settlement protocols must decide how to convey symbology between market participants. The _lingua franca_ in financial markets is the FIX protocol, which uses the [`Instrument`](https://fiximate.fixtrading.org/en/FIX.Latest/cmp1003.html) component block. Other examples include Goldman Sach's [`AssetIdentifier`](https://developer.gs.com/docs/gsquant/api/classes/gs_quant.markets.securities.AssetIdentifier.html#gs_quant.markets.securities.AssetIdentifier) for their Quant platform and Interactive Broker's [`SecIdType`](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/basic_contracts.html) for their Trader Workstation. These three protocols—developed independently and designed for different purposes—model symbology the _same_ with two fields: a string value along with a discriminator denoting the type (e.g., FIX's [SecurityIdSource(22)](https://fiximate.fixtrading.org/en/FIX.Latest/tag22.html) and [SecurityId(48)](https://fiximate.fixtrading.org/en/FIX.Latest/tag48.html)).

```rust
enum SecurityIdType {
    FIGI,
    ISIN,
    // ...
}

struct CreateOrder {
    security_id: Option<String>,
    security_id_source: Option<SecurityIdType>,
    // ...
}
```

While this modeling makes sense for wire formats bound to backwards-compatibility, it has no place in business logic maximising _correctness_ and _simplicity_. Imagine creating an API for fetching the [VWAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume-weighted_average_price) for an equity trading on a specific exchange. A naive API signature would be `fetch_vwap(id: &str, id_type: IdType) -> u64`, but calling this _correctly_ requires meeting certain (undocumented) _pre-conditions_ of the identifier:

1. adherence to the syntactic requirements set forth by a specification
2. granular enough to uniquely identify an instruemnt at a trading venue level (versus e.g. a global-share class identifer)

Implementing these checks inside the `fetch_vwap` function for many such APIs is not acceptable. Instead, we can use the [parse, don't validate](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/) idiom for parsing identifier strings into [universal domain types](https://mmapped.blog/posts/25-domain-types). In Rust, this is called the [NewType](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/generics/new_types.html) pattern, which usually wraps primitive types in a single-field [tuple struct](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html#using-tuple-structs-without-named-fields-to-create-different-types). We then implement [conversion traits](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/conversion/string.html) like `FromStr` to construct these domain types, providing a natural place for validation checks.

```rust
struct Figi(String);

impl FromStr for Figi {
	type Err = FigiParseError;

	fn from_str(s: &str) -> Result<Self, Self::Err> {
	       // Enforce conformance to FIGI's specification
		// Returning an `Ok` on success or `Err` if input is malformed
		todo!()
	}
}

assert(Figi::from_str("BBG000B9XVV8").is_ok());
assert(Figi::from_str("US0378331005").is_err());
```

Our VWAP function can then be implemented like so:

```rust
async fn fetch_exchange_vwap(figi: &Figi) -> u64 { ... }
```

By embedding correctness into the _type-system_, we have eliminated all three aforementioned concerns with the naive API, providing a robust approach to modeling FIGIs in our application.

## Parsing Imperatively

Now that we have a NewType `Figi` and a fallible constructor `from_str`, we must decide _how_ to implement the validation logic. As outlined before, the structure is relatively simple, and hand-rolling a validation function is trivial. Let's translate Python's [stdnum](https://pypi.org/project/python-stdnum/) implementation of [`figi.validate`](https://github.com/arthurdejong/python-stdnum/blob/master/stdnum/figi.py#L61) as our Rust baseline ([full code](https://github.com/wcwagner/rusty/blob/main/crates/symbology/src/figi_imperative.rs)):

```rust
pub struct Figi(pub String);

pub enum FigiParseError {
    InvalidLength,
    InvalidFormat,
    InvalidComponent,
    InvalidChecksum,
}

impl FromStr for Figi {
    type Err = FigiParseError;

    fn from_str(s: &str) -> Result<Self, Self::Err> {
        let valid_chars = "0123456789BCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ";
        if s.len() != 12 {
            return Err(FigiParseError::InvalidLength);
        }
        if !s.chars().all(|c| valid_chars.contains(c)) {
            return Err(FigiParseError::InvalidFormat);
        }
        match &s[0..2] {
            "BS" | "BM" | "GG" | "GB" | "VG" => return Err(FigiParseError::InvalidComponent),
            _ => {}
        }
        if &s[2..3] != "G" {
            return Err(FigiParseError::InvalidComponent);
        }
        if !s.chars().last().unwrap().is_digit(10) {
            return Err(FigiParseError::InvalidChecksum);
        }
        Ok(Self(s.to_string()))
    }
}
```

Note that the _logic_ is the same as stdnum's, but the approaches differ greatly in how and when it is called (i.e., ad-hoc in Python but systematic in Rust). Some argue for "[writing Python like it's Rust](https://kobzol.github.io/rust/python/2023/05/20/writing-python-like-its-rust.html)", but deviating from conventions rarely takes hold. Nevertheless, we've solved two "issues" from the Python implementation:

1. Systematic enforcement of FIGI well-formedness at construction time
2. Errors (in the signature) that must be handled at the call site

The [tests](https://github.com/wcwagner/rusty/blob/5bb9c156a5ec132fba59a3d393467a1a86169252/crates/symbology/src/figi_imperative.rs#L49-L102) pass and the [benchmark](https://github.com/wcwagner/rusty/blob/5bb9c156a5ec132fba59a3d393467a1a86169252/crates/symbology/benches/benchmark.rs#L30-L39) clocks in at **80.945 ns**, so this is pretty solid! We have created a more intutive API, that is performant, has decent error ergonomics, and leverages the type system. But what about composability?

## Composability of parsers

Composability in the abstract _never_ helped me grok what it meant in practice. Instead, we will look at a real-world example where we must parse a FIGI as part of a larger format. Bloomberg's [BLPAPI](https://data.bloomberglp.com/professional/sites/10/2017/03/BLPAPI-Core-User-Guide.pdf) is a perfect for that. The syntax for Symbology (a methodology for identifying securities), as defined in § 3.2, consists of following components seperated by a "/":

- **Identifier Type**: "ticker", "cusip", "isin", "sedol1", "sedol2", "buid", "bbgid", "bsym", etc.
- **Identifier Value**: Unique identifier value according to Identifier Type
- **Provider**: Optional mnemonic that has contributed pricing for the given
  security preceded by a “@”. If <Provider> is not specified, a default value may apply depending on product.
- **Pricing Source**: Optional, generally two-character mnemonic for the data source where the security is traded. For example, in the Equities Business, the Data Source is the Exchange
- **Yellow Key**: market sector—"Govt", "Corp", "Mtge", "M-Mkt", "Muni", "Pfd", "Equity", "Comdty", "Index" "Curncy"

Using the Govt (i.e. treasury bond) example "/bbgid/BBG007Z1JW11@BVAL" we have two components (the type and pricing source) that we must parse _in addition to_ the FIGI.

Parser combinators initially seemed like tools solely for functional programming savants. Thankfully, introductory posts like [Practical Parsing in Rust with nom](https://naiveai.hashnode.dev/practical-parsing-nom) and [Error recovery with parser combinators](https://eyalkalderon.com/blog/nom-error-recovery/) revealed their approachability and usefulness. For our use case, they are superior in their composability with other parsers.

Composability is a term I never truly grasped. So let's start with Bloomberg's [BLPAPI](https://data.bloomberglp.com/professional/sites/10/2017/03/BLPAPI-Core-User-Guide.pdf), which defines identifiers as `/<Identifier Type>/<Identifier Value>[@Provider| Pricing Source] <Yellow Key>`. Here we only consider `<Identifier Type>` as "bbgid" (FIGI). Some examples:

| Asset  | Identifier                                  | Note                                                                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Govt   | "//blp/mktdata/bbgid<br>/BBG007Z1JW11@BVAL" | `@BVAL` is a pricing source, akin to an exchange from a pricing perspective |
| Equity | "//blp/mktdata/<br>bbgid/BBG000B9XVV8"      | FIGI here is most granular, pointing to a specific exchange                 |

The first components ("//blp/mktdata") are the service schema defined as `//blp/<servicename>`, supporting:

1. "//blp/refdata" for reference data
2. "//blp/mktdata" for market data
3. "//blp/mktbar" for market bar data

The second major component is the security identifier which includes FIGI along with other commonly used types. Just as the specifications decompose the top-level identifier into smaller parts, we can decompose our parsers into smaller (and independent) parts, composing them to handle more complex structures.

## Worked Combinators

Many combinator libraries exist in Rust: [nom](https://docs.rs/nom/latest/nom/), [chumsky](https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky), [winnow](https://docs.rs/winnow/latest/winnow/index.html), [monch](https://github.com/denoland/monch). All are superb, but I chose winnow for its extensive [blog posts](https://epage.github.io/blog/), [tutorials](https://docs.rs/winnow/latest/winnow/_tutorial/chapter_0/index.html), and [special topics](https://docs.rs/winnow/latest/winnow/_topic/index.html).

### BLPAPI Service

We'll model our types first:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
pub enum Scheme {
    BLP,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub enum Provider {
    RefData,
    MktData,
    MktBar,
}

#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
pub struct Service {
    scheme: Scheme,
    provider: Provider,
}
```

Then we parse them using winnow:

```rust
fn scheme<'s>(i: &mut &'s str) -> PResult<Scheme> {
    "blp".value(Scheme::BLP).parse_next(i)
}

fn provider<'s>(i: &mut &'s str) -> PResult<Provider> {
    alt((
        "refdata".value(Provider::RefData),
        "mktdata".value(Provider::MktData),
        "mktbar".value(Provider::MktBar),
    ))
    .parse_next(i)
}
```

This uses [built-in Rust type](https://epage.github.io/blog/2023/02/winnow-toml-edit-combine-nom/#winnow) for constructing parsers, so rather than `literal("blp")` we use [`impl Parser for &'s str`](https://docs.rs/winnow/latest/winnow/trait.Parser.html#impl-Parser%3CI,+%3CI+as+Stream%3E::Slice,+E%3E-for-%26str) provided by Winnow. The [`Parser`](https://docs.rs/winnow/latest/winnow/trait.Parser.html) trait implements a few combinators directly, e.g. [`Parser::value`](https://docs.rs/winnow/latest/winnow/trait.Parser.html#method.value) to produce a value as output.

To compose these into `Service`, expecting `//<scheme>/<provider>` and [ignoring trivia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivia):

```rust
fn service<'s>(i: &mut &'s str) -> PResult<Service> {
    ("//", scheme, "/", provider)
        .map(|(_, scheme, _, provider)| Service { scheme, provider })
        .parse_next(i)
}
```

Here we are using Winnow's [`impl Parser for (P1, P2, P3, P4)`](<https://docs.rs/winnow/latest/winnow/trait.Parser.html#impl-Parser%3CI,+(O1,+O2,+O3,+O4),+E%3E-for-(P1,+P2,+P3,+P4)>) to create a parser from a `tuple` of size 4. This pattern of mapping a sequence of parsers into a `struct` is common enough that a macro-based combinator, [`seq!`](https://docs.rs/winnow/latest/winnow/combinator/macro.seq.html), exists to make this easier.

```rust
fn service<'s>(i: &mut &'s str) -> PResult<Service> {
    seq! {
        Service{
            _: "//",
            scheme: scheme,
            _: "/",
            provider: provider
        }
    }
    .parse_next(i)
}
```

Using cargo expand we can view the expansion:

```rust
fn service<'s>(i: &mut &'s str) -> PResult<Service> {
    ::winnow::combinator::trace(
            "Service",
            move |input: &mut _| {
                use ::winnow::Parser;
                let _ = "//".parse_next(input)?;
                let scheme = scheme.parse_next(input)?;
                let _ = "/".parse_next(input)?;
                let provider = provider.parse_next(input)?;
                #[allow(clippy::redundant_field_names)]
                Ok(Service {
                    scheme: scheme,
                    provider: provider,
                })
            },
        )
        .parse_next(i)
}
```

We see a more imperative implementaiton here, which is _encouraged_ as one of Winnow's stated goals is to be an "[introspectable toolbox that can easily be customized at any level"](https://docs.rs/winnow/latest/winnow/_topic/why/index.html#chumsky).

### BLPAPI Identifier

On to the "/bbgid/…" identifier portion, we face two aspects different from `Service`:

1. **Path-dependence**: the `<id>` parser depends on the `<id_type>` parser
2. **Backtracking**: `alt` backtracks on failure, which doesn't make sense once we parse `id_type`

We solve this with `cut_err` to disable other branches upon error (see [Chapter 6](https://docs.rs/winnow/latest/winnow/_tutorial/chapter_6/index.html#errmode) for more detail):

```rust
alt((
  ("figi", cut_err(figi)).context(StrContext::Label("FIGI")),
  ("isin", cut_err(isin)).context(StrContext::Label("ISIN")),
  ...
))
```

Another pattern is the trivia ("/") between components. Combinators like [`preceded`](https://docs.rs/winnow/latest/winnow/combinator/fn.preceded.html) and [`delimited`](https://docs.rs/winnow/latest/winnow/combinator/fn.delimited.html) can ignore complex sets of trivia.

**WIP**

# Conclusion

In summary, parser combinators in Rust enable powerful, composable solutions for financial identifiers. With the NewType pattern, clear error handling, and expressive APIs, Rust helps us model this domain robustly and ergonomically. I hope this foray into Rust and parser combinators inspires you to explore their potential for enhancing financial software systems.

# Footnotes

[^1] : Section 2.2 in [FIGI allocation rules](https://www.openfigi.com/assets/local/figi-allocation-rules.pdf) shows this hierarchy. This is specific to Equity securities which have a primary listing on an exchange but trade on all national exchanges for liquidity purposes. The [Unlisted Trading Privileges](https://www.sec.gov/rules/2000/08/unlisted-trading-privileges) act of 1994 was key in this development. For example, AAPL stock has a share-class level that is useful for cross-border transactions (i.e., trade on Eurex but settle in US DTC), a composite level for a consolidated pricing feed across all US exchanges, and an exchange-level for pricing/execution on specific exchanges ([ATS](https://www.sec.gov/foia/docs/atslist)). All three cases necessitate a different identifier.<br></br>
[^2]: By all asset classes we primarily mean exchange-traded products and debt instruments that trade in secondary markets. There are other heavily traded asset-classes where symbology is not as easy or relevant, such OTC private placements like forwards, money-markets, and swaps, or exchange-traded "contracts" like options, futures, commodities, and forex spots/forwards
