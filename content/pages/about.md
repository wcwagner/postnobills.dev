My name is William Wagner but people call me Bill(y). I'm a software engineer at [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/careers/working-here/engineering/), where I work on their [buy-side OMS](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/products/trading/order-management-system/aim/). All opinions are my own.

Currently I am interested in building [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) libraries for working with and understanding the [FIX](https://www.fixtrading.org) protocol. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/wcwagner) or [send me](<(mailto:wcwwagner+blog@gmail.com)>) an email.
